# Arch Linux Distrohop

What to do after the installation of the latest version of ArchLinux?

Personally I will install these applications with the use of the scripts.
These are applications not everyone would want on an iso.

But I will also remove applications from my system.

What is more I will use these scripts to install my apps and configs on a variety of Arch Linux based systems.

So choose whatever Arch based system you want and stay in control via scripts.
